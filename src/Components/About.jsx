            Hi! Iâ€™m Jonathan Hubert, a web developer with a background as a
            research scientist.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a research scientist, I developed a strong foundation in critical
            thinking, problem-solving, and attention to detail. These skills
            have proven invaluable in my transition to web development, where I
            approach each project with a rigorous and analytical mindset.
            <br />
            <br />
            What I love most about web development is the ability to bring ideas
            to life. In the same way that a scientist designs experiments to
            test hypotheses, a web developer designs websites and applications
            to meet user needs.
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest trends and
            technologies in the field, and I'm always eager to take on new
            challenges.
