                <p className='about-text main-text'>Hi! Iâ€™m Jonathan Hubert, a web developer with a unique background as a research scientist. 
                    <br/><br/>As a research scientist, I developed a strong foundation in critical thinking, problem-solving, and attention to detail. These skills have proven invaluable in my transition to web development, where I approach each project with a rigorous and analytical mindset. 
                    <br/><br/>What I love most about web development is the ability to bring ideas to life. In the same way that a scientist designs experiments to test hypotheses, a web developer designs websites and applications to meet user needs.
                    <br/><br/>I'm passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the field, and I'm always eager to take on new challenges.
